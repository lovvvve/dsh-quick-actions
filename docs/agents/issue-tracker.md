# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and specs for this repo live as markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01` — never a single combined tickets file
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file
- Comments and conversation history append under a `## Comments` heading

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path.

## Wayfinding operations

- **Map**: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md`
- **Child ticket**: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`; `Type:` is `research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`, and `Status:` is `claimed`/`resolved`
- **Blocking**: `Blocked by: NN, NN`
- **Frontier**: open, unblocked, unclaimed tickets; first by number wins
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` before work
- **Resolve**: append `## Answer`, set `Status: resolved`, then add a gist and link to the map’s Decisions-so-far
